# Tongji-Advanced-Language-Programing-2024

同济大学 2024 春 高级语言程序设计 课程作业

A record of my experience during the advanced programming course, spring 2024, at Tongji University.

Advanced language programming may be the course I have devoted the most during the past two years at Tongji, and probably also be the most in the years ahead. Pushing my code to the git eventually ends this course.

I have gained much help from previous people's code during the learning in both this one and other cources. And I am also going to be one of such contributors.
